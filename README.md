# dWarehouse
This dWarehouse smart contract implements a web application for marketing and managing commercial real estate warehouse properties/go-downs (i.e. facilities that are designed for storing and distributing goods on lease basis). 
The platform enables warehouse owners and real estate property managers to list (market) their warehouse properties and services for clients to engage with their details which include: space size, cold/dry room capacity, location, whether available or engaged, date of next availability etc.
Also, warehouse owners or property managers get tools to manage client bookings and reservations of their warehouse properties/facilities. 
On the other hand, clients interact with the dApp's displayed warehouse advertisements and get options to schedule or cancel bookings of warehousing services.
